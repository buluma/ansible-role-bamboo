## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-bamboo/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: true

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bamboo
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-bamboo/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Install sudo if missing
      ansible.builtin.raw: "{{ ansible_pkg_mgr | default('dnf') }} install -y sudo"
      become: false
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
    - role: buluma.setuptools
    - role: buluma.openssl
```
